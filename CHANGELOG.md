# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-14

First tagged release: the core loop works end-to-end, self-hosted.

### Added

- **intervals.icu sync** — wellness (HRV, resting HR, sleep), activities, and
  precomputed CTL/ATL, kept fresh by an in-process scheduler with idempotent
  jobs and a `/api/cron` fallback for serverless deploys.
- **Readiness engine** — daily score from 60-day rolling personal baselines
  (HRV 40%, resting HR 25%, sleep 20%, form/TSB 15%), with a calibrating
  state below 14 days of history and a persisted component breakdown.
- **Dashboard, performance log, and behavior journal** — readiness/recovery/
  strain rings, strain budget, training stress balance chart, wellness
  sliders, mood/tags/notes.
- **AI coach** — streaming chat with an evidence-based endurance-coach
  persona that cites real numbers via a shared tool registry. Bring your own
  key: Anthropic or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama included). Keys
  encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).
- **MCP server** — stateless streamable-HTTP endpoint at `/api/mcp` with
  hashed, scoped (`read` / `write:wellness`), revocable bearer tokens and
  rate limiting, exposing nine tools shared with the coach.
- **Multi-user** — invite-only signup, owner/member roles, full per-user data
  isolation across web and MCP.
- **Strava OAuth** — second activity source with provenance tracking;
  excluded from AI/MCP context by default per Strava's API terms.
- **Self-hosting** — multi-stage Docker image (published to GHCR for
  amd64/arm64), docker-compose with Postgres 16 and optional Cloudflare
  tunnel profile, migrations applied automatically on boot.
- **Demo seed** — `SEED_DEMO=1 npm run db:seed-demo` generates 90 days of
  deterministic, plausible training history for demos and screenshots.
