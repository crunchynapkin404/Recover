# Changelog

## v0.5.0 — Training Intelligence

- **Artifacts engine**: coach can output inline SVG charts (line, bar, area, table) in chat — collapsed preview with expand-on-click
- **Weekly review**: proactive weekly training summary with load comparison chart, configurable day/time
- **Calendar integration**: intervals.icu planned workouts visible to coach; Google Calendar OAuth for busy/free awareness
- **Training plan generation**: periodized multi-week plans from race goals (4–52 weeks, multi-sport, periodization guardrails)
- **20 MCP tools** (was 14): `render_chart`, `get_planned_workouts`, `get_calendar_availability`, `generate_training_plan`, `get_training_plan`, `update_training_plan`

## v0.4.0 — Unreleased

Coach intelligence.

### Added

- MCP depth: `get_power_curve`, `get_pace_curve`, `get_best_efforts` (intervals.icu precomputed, 6 h cache, stale-if-error) and weekly-bucket `get_training_load_summary`.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-07-14

Analytics depth.

### Added

- **Activity detail page** (`/activity/[id]`): stream charts (heart rate,
  power, pace, elevation) and a laps/intervals table. Streams are fetched
  lazily from intervals.icu on first view and cached; Strava/manual
  activities show the summary with a "no detailed data" note.
- **Performance page tabs** (Training | Wellness) with a 30/90/180/365-day
  range selector, both linkable via URL params.
- **Training tab**: PMC chart now spans the selected range and draws TSB as
  a filled area around zero; 12-week load bars; history list grouped by day
  with "load more", each row linking to the activity detail.
- **Wellness tab**: HRV and resting-HR trends (daily line, 7-day rolling
  average, personal 60-day baseline band) and a sleep chart (duration bars,
  score line, 8 h guide).
- Dashboard recent activities now link to their detail pages.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-07-14

Phone & daily loop.

### Added

- **Installable PWA**: web manifest, app icons, minimal service worker with
  offline fallback.
- **Morning readiness push** (web-push/VAPID): sent right after the overnight
  sync computes the day's score — at most once per day, only when a score
  exists, skipped while calibrating. VAPID keys are auto-generated and stored
  in the database (private key encrypted); no new configuration.
- **Notifications settings card**: per-device subscribe/unsubscribe, morning
  push preference, send-test-notification, iOS install hint.
- **Manual resync**: dashboard sync chip ("Synced 12m ago ⟳") and
  pull-to-refresh in the installed app, backed by a rate-limited
  `/api/sync/now` (one per 2 minutes per user).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-14

First tagged release: the core loop works end-to-end, self-hosted.

### Added

- **intervals.icu sync** — wellness (HRV, resting HR, sleep), activities, and
  precomputed CTL/ATL, kept fresh by an in-process scheduler with idempotent
  jobs and a `/api/cron` fallback for serverless deploys.
- **Readiness engine** — daily score from 60-day rolling personal baselines
  (HRV 40%, resting HR 25%, sleep 20%, form/TSB 15%), with a calibrating
  state below 14 days of history and a persisted component breakdown.
- **Dashboard, performance log, and behavior journal** — readiness/recovery/
  strain rings, strain budget, training stress balance chart, wellness
  sliders, mood/tags/notes.
- **AI coach** — streaming chat with an evidence-based endurance-coach
  persona that cites real numbers via a shared tool registry. Bring your own
  key: Anthropic or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama included). Keys
  encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).
- **MCP server** — stateless streamable-HTTP endpoint at `/api/mcp` with
  hashed, scoped (`read` / `write:wellness`), revocable bearer tokens and
  rate limiting, exposing nine tools shared with the coach.
- **Multi-user** — invite-only signup, owner/member roles, full per-user data
  isolation across web and MCP.
- **Strava OAuth** — second activity source with provenance tracking;
  excluded from AI/MCP context by default per Strava's API terms.
- **Self-hosting** — multi-stage Docker image (published to GHCR for
  amd64/arm64), docker-compose with Postgres 16 and optional Cloudflare
  tunnel profile, migrations applied automatically on boot.
- **Demo seed** — `SEED_DEMO=1 npm run db:seed-demo` generates 90 days of
  deterministic, plausible training history for demos and screenshots.
